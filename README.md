# Description

This is a Readme file for the tasks and assignments in the Programming and Scripting Module 2020. This Repository contains the Weekly Task code for the various assigments from the Programming and Scripting Course. 

In total there are 7 different tasks. The student is required to write a program for each of these tasks in Python. Each program can be looked at in more detail in the Table of Contents below.

# Table of Contents

1. [BMI Calculator](#bmi-calculator)
2. [Second String](#second-string)
3. [Collatz](#collatz)
      
# BMI Calculator
This program asks the user to input their Weight (in KG) and Height (in Cm). The program then caluclates the BMI from these inputs and prints the result to 2 decimal places.

Error handling in place for user input

To Run: python bmi.py

# Second String
This program asks the user to input a sentence and will output every second letter of the input in reverse order

Program Code: https://github.com/conor1982/Python_Module/blob/master/secondstring.py 

To Run: python secondstring.py

# Collatz
This program asks the user to input a positive integer. If the integer is even it will divide it by 2. If it is odd it will multiply the integer by 3 and add 1.

The program will loop through the numbers until in reaches a value of 1 and the loop ends.

While loop is used in this program for:
 a) looping through the numbers
 b) for error handling if a positive integer is not entered by the user.
